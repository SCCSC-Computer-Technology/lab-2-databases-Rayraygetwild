Hello, Au'rias, I have just read over the code for your lab 2, and I think you did a good job on it overall. 
Everything is well-organized and easy to read, and your SQL functions for average, ascending, etc. are also organized well.
When I ran the program, the UI was also organized in an even fashion, and it ran successfully without error. All the buttons
performed their proper functions and the data was easy and clear to read. A way your code differed from mine was that
you chose to display stats in their own individual message-boxes, while I displayed mine in one message-box. One thing I may change
would be to name the buttons "btnName" instead of "buttName", but it's up to you. Overall, you did a good job on the Lab2.
