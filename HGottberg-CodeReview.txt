Heinrich Gottberg Code Review of Ray Ray Lab 2

Is the code generally readable and well-documented?

	Yes the code is very clean and has no unnecessary lines. Things are spaced 	out well. There are comments detailing what everything does. I prefer my to 	put my comments above the actual block of code but inside works just as well.

Did you find any software defects?

	No, the program ran as expected. The database loaded in correctly and the 
	data was preserved.

What was one way that their solution differed from yours?

	I used number formatting to give commas to the population numbers, also I put 	the name of the city that had lowest and highest population.

Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

	I would format the numbers in your output but it isn't too vital to the 
	programs success.

This code is very clean! It was super easy to tell what everything did and wasn't hard to find anything. All the requirements were met. Great job.
